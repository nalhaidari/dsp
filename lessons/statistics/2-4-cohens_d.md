[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

d (totalwgt_lb) = -0.088672927072602
that's mean firsts are dilvered slightly lower in wight than others
while (prglength) = 0.028879044654449883
which mean the pregrancy length tend to be to longer to firsts

for sure both are not high enough to confirm a conclusion but wight affected more than the length.
